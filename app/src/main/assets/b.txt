In the Rocking Horse sex position he sits cross-legged and leans back supporting himself with both arms behind him. She kneels over his lap hugging him with her thighs and lowers herself down. She can then determine the speed and depth of penetration. t may be easier to maintain the Rocking Horse sex position for the man to lean against a wall or the edge of the bed and help her bounce up and down or just cop a feel while she does all the hard work.

The Catherine Wheel sex position is more complicated than it looks. First the man and the woman sit down opposite each other. Now she wraps her legs round his torso and he enters her, he then wraps one leg over her to hold her in place. In order to hold the balance, she braces herself with both hands. He guides the movement propped up on his elbow.

At first glance, the Glowing Triangle position reminds us of the classic missionary position - woman on her back and the man on top. However the trick with this position is that the man goes on all fours then the woman lifts her hips towards his penis so that he can penetrate her. The man remains in this position while the woman does all the work... so actually not like the missionary at all.

The X-Rated sex position is all about control. He lies faceup on the bed, she turns around and straddles him — so her back is toward him — she then lowers herself onto him. She extends her legs back toward his shoulders, relaxing her torso onto the bed between his feet. With both her legs and his forming an X-shape, she starts to slide up and down.

The Nirvana sex position is a classic. When trying the Nirvana sex position, she lies on her back, stretches her legs out and holds onto the bedposts above her head. She keeps her legs together as he enters her with his thighs outside hers. They move together and the pressure of her thighs intensifies the penetration effect and provides for a natural stimulation of the clitoris.
